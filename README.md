## Students List App

This is my first **React App** i made.
I used: [React+Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) ,**HTML+CSS**.
I did my best to keep the ***React Thinking*** aproach,
which is about components dividing.
I also used ***Context Provider*** and ***Browser Router***,
and some base hooks like a ***"UseState"***. 
Browser local storage was used as DataBase.


### How to run the App:

* Go to console in app directory enter command `npm i` 
* Then in console enter command `npm run dev` 
* In your browser follow the link that will appear in console

### Description:

You can register and then login, all new users will be saved in local storage.
At homepage you can see all students they are availbe to be edited or removed, also you can add new one.
You can make admin user which can manage all users of this app just like students.
In order to create admin user just write "admin" in username input when you registering.
